# Joe Fontanarosa and Moses Akinola's OPIM5512 Ping Pong Assignment

This project attempts to train an MLPRegressor model to predict home value based on the features in the California Housing Dataset.

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the ca_housing_pipeline.py file - two scatterplots will be generated which will have to be dismissed in order for the file to continue running


## Expected Output:

Two scatterplots displaying the predicted vs actual home value for our training and testing datasets. Additionally, terminal output includes critical error metrics
describing the performance of the model.
